/// ## Examples
///
/// ### Using the discovery protocol
///
/// The device_tracker can be created via publishing to a discovery topic that follows the following [MQTT Discovery](/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery#discovery-topic) topic name format: `<discovery_prefix>/device_tracker/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config`.
///
/// You can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.
///
/// To create the device_tracker:
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t homeassistant/device_tracker/a4567d663eaf/config -m '{"state_topic": "a4567d663eaf/state", "name": "My Tracker", "payload_home": "home", "payload_not_home": "not_home"}'
/// ```
///
/// To set the state of the device tracker to "home":
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m 'home'
/// ```
///
/// To set the state of the device tracker to a named location:
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m 'location_name'
/// ```
///
/// If the device supports GPS coordinates then they can be sent to Home Assistant by specifying an attributes topic (i.e. "json_attributes_topic") in the configuration payload:
///
/// - Attributes topic: `a4567d663eaf/attributes`
/// - Example attributes payload:
///
/// Example message to be received at topic `a4567d663eaf/attributes`:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   "latitude": 32.87336,
///   "longitude": -117.22743,
///   "gps_accuracy": 1.2
///  }
/// ```
///
/// To create the device_tracker with GPS coordinates support:
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t homeassistant/device_tracker/a4567d663eaf/config -m '{"json_attributes_topic": "a4567d663eaf/attributes", "name": "My Tracker"}'
/// ```
///
/// <div class='note info'>
///
/// Using `state_topic` is optional when using `json_attributes_topic` to determine the state of the device tracker.
///
/// </div>
///
/// To set the state of the device tracker to specific coordinates:
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/attributes -m '{"latitude": 32.87336, "longitude": -117.22743, "gps_accuracy": 1.2}'
/// ```
///
///
/// ### YAML configuration
///
/// The following example shows how to configure the same device tracker through configuration.yaml
///
/// {% raw %}
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - device_tracker:
