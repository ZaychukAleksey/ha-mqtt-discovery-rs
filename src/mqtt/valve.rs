/// title: "MQTT Valve"
/// description: "Instructions on how to integrate MQTT valves into Home Assistant."
/// ha_category:
///   - Valve
/// ha_iot_class: Configurable
/// ha_release: 2024.1
/// ha_domain: mqtt
/// ---
///
/// The `mqtt` valve platform allows you to control an MQTT valve (such a gas or water valve).
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// A valve entity can be have the following states: `open`, `opening`, `closed` or `closing`.
///
/// ### Valve controlled by states
///
/// If a `state_topic` is configured, the entity's state will be updated only after an MQTT message is received on `state_topic` matching `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed` or `state_closing`. Commands configured through `payload_open`, `payload_closed`, and `payload_stop` will be published to `command_topic` to control the valve.
///
/// To use your MQTT valve in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry for a value that is set by open or close command
/// mqtt:
///   - valve:
///       command_topic: "home-assistant/valve/set"
///       state_topic: "home-assistant/valve/state"
/// ```
///
/// ### Valve controlled by position
///
/// If the valve supports reporting its position (the `reports_position` config option is set to `true`), a numeric state is expected on `state_topic`, but state updates are still allowed for `state_opening` and `state_closing`. Also, a JSON format is supported. It allows both `state` and `position` to be reported together.
///
/// Example of a JSON state update:
///
/// ```json
/// {"state": "opening", "position": 10}
/// ```
///
/// The wanted position value or `payload_stop` will be published to `command_topic` to control the valve when the services `valve.open`, `value.close`, or `value.set_position` are called.
///
/// To use your MQTT valve in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry for a valve that reports position
/// mqtt:
///   - valve:
///       command_topic: "home-assistant/valve/set"
///       state_topic: "home-assistant/valve/state"
///       reports_position: true
/// ```
///
/// ### Optimistic operation
///
/// If a `state_topic` is not defined, the valve will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the valve will immediately change state (`open` or `closed`) after every command sent by Home Assistant. It won't wait for an update from the device. Optimistic mode can be forced by setting `optimistic` to `true`, even if a `state_topic` is defined. Try to enable it if you are experiencing an incorrect valve operation.

///

/// ### Sample configuration of a valve that reports the position
///
/// The example below shows a sample configuration for a valve that reports the position using JSON messages.
///
/// {% raw %}
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - valve:
///       name: "MQTT valve"
///       command_template: '{"x": {{ value }} }'
///       command_topic: "home-assistant/valve/set"

///       reports_position: true
///       value_template: "{{ value_json.x }}"
/// ```
///
/// {% endraw %}
///
/// ### Configuration for disabling valve commands
///
/// The example below shows a configuration for a valve that does not have a close command.
/// Setting the `payload_close` to empty or to `null` disables the close command and will not show the close button.
///
/// {% raw %}
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - valve:
///       payload_open: "on"
///       payload_close:
///       payload_stop: "on"

/// {% endraw %}

/// An MQTT valve will support `open` and `close` commands if a `command_topic` is set. The MQTT valve supports `stop` if `payload_stop` is set.

/// ### Testing your configuration
///
/// To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your valve manually:
