///         - max
///       send_command_topic: "vacuum/send_command"
/// ```
///
/// ## MQTT Protocol
///
/// The  configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.
///
/// ### Basic Commands
///
/// MQTT topic: `vacuum/command`
///
/// Possible MQTT payloads:
///
/// - `start` - Start cleaning
/// - `pause` - Pause cleaning
/// - `return_to_base` - Return to base/dock
/// - `stop` - Stop the vacuum.
/// - `clean_spot` - Initialize a spot cleaning cycle
/// - `locate` - Locate the vacuum (typically by playing a song)
///
/// ### Send custom command
///
/// Vacuum send_command allows three parameters:
///
/// - entity_id
/// - command
/// - params - optional
///
/// If params are not provided it sends command as payload to MQTT send_command topic.
/// If params are provided service sends JSON as payload with such structure:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   'command': 'command',
///   'param1-key': 'param1-value'
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Service trigger example:
///
/// ```yaml
/// - alias: "Push command based on sensor"
///     trigger:
///       - platform: state
///         entity_id: sensor.sensor
///     action:
///       service: vacuum.send_command
///       target:
///         entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
///       data:
///         command: "custom_command"
///         params:
///           - key: value
/// ```
///
/// MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`
///
/// ### Status/Sensor Updates
///
/// MQTT topic: `vacuum/state`
///
/// MQTT payload:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///     "battery_level": 61,
///     "state": "docked",
///     "fan_speed": "off"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// State has to be one of vacuum states supported by Home Assistant:
///
/// - cleaning,
/// - docked,
/// - paused,
/// - idle,
/// - returning,
/// - error.
///
/// ### Set Fan Speed
///
/// MQTT topic: `vacuum/set_fan_speed`
///
/// Possible MQTT payloads:
///
/// - `min` - Minimum fan speed
/// - `medium` - Medium fan speed
/// - `high` - High fan speed
/// - `max` - Max fan speed
///
/// ## Usage examples
///
/// ### Usage with cloudless Xiaomi vacuums
///
/// This integration is supported by the cloud-free Xiaomi Vacuum Webinterface [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo).
///
/// ### Retrofitting non-wifi vacuums
///
/// - Retrofitting your old Roomba with an ESP8266. [This repository](https://github.com/johnboiles/esp-roomba-mqtt) provides MQTT client firmware.
/// - If you own a non-wifi Neato, you can refer to [this repository](https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/neato-serial) that uses a Raspberry Pi to retrofit an old Neato.
