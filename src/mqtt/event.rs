/// The `mqtt` event platform allows you to process event info from an MQTT message. Events are signals that are emitted when something happens, for example, when a user presses a physical button like a doorbell or when a button on a remote control is pressed. With the event some event attributes can be sent to become available as an attribute on the entity. MQTT events are stateless. For example, a doorbell does not have a state like being "on" or "off" but instead is momentarily pressed.

/// ### Full configuration with JSON data
///
/// The example below shows a full configuration for an event MQTT entity.

/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - event:
///       state_topic: "home/doorbell/state"
///       event_types:
///         - "press"
///         - "hold"
///       availability:
///         - topic: "home/doorbell/available"
///       qos: 0
///       device_class: "doorbell"
/// ```
///
/// The event information is extracted from a JSON formatted MQTT message.
/// To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.
///
/// To set trigger the `mqtt` event entity manually:
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home/doorbell/available -m "online"
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home/doorbell/state -m '{"event_type": "hold"}'
/// ```
///
/// Besides the required `event_type` element, the payload can contain additional event attributes.
/// These additional attribute updates will be exposed as attributes on the `mqtt` event entity.
///
/// The example below demonstrates how event attributes can be added to the event data.
///
/// ```bash
/// mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home/doorbell/state -m '{"event_type": "press", "duration": 0.1}'
/// ```
///
/// ### Example: processing event data using a value template
///
/// In many cases, translation of an existing published payload is needed.
/// The example config below translates the payload `{"Button1": {"Action": "SINGLE"}}` of
/// the device `Button1` with event type `single` to the required format.
/// An extra attribute `button` will be set to `Button1` and be added to the entity,
/// but only if the `Action` property is set. Empty dictionaries will be ignored.
///
/// {% raw %}
///
/// ```yaml
/// mqtt:
///   - event:
///       name: "Desk button"
///       state_topic: "desk/button/state"
///       event_types:
///         - single
