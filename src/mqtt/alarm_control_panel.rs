/// title: "MQTT Alarm control panel"
/// description: "Instructions on how to integrate MQTT capable alarm panels into Home Assistant."
/// ha_category:
///   - Alarm
/// ha_release: 0.7.4
/// ha_iot_class: Configurable
/// ha_domain: mqtt
/// ---
///
/// The `mqtt` alarm panel platform enables the possibility to control MQTT capable alarm panels. The Alarm icon will change state after receiving a new state from `state_topic`. If these messages are published with *RETAIN* flag, the MQTT alarm panel will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state will be `unknown`.
///
/// The integration will accept the following states from your Alarm Panel (in lower case):
///
/// - `disarmed`
/// - `armed_home`
/// - `armed_away`
/// - `armed_night`
/// - `armed_vacation`
/// - `armed_custom_bypass`
/// - `pending`
/// - `triggered`
/// - `arming`
/// - `disarming`
///
/// The integration can control your Alarm Panel by publishing to the `command_topic` when a user interacts with the Home Assistant frontend.
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// To enable this platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - alarm_control_panel:
///       state_topic: "home/alarm"
