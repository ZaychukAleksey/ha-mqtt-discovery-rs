/// title: "MQTT Camera"
/// description: "Instructions on how to use an MQTT image message as a Camera within Home Assistant."
/// ha_category:
///   - Camera
/// ha_release: 0.43
/// ha_iot_class: Configurable

///
/// The `mqtt` camera platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as a camera. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated. Messages received on `topic` should contain the full contents of an image file, for example, a JPEG image, without any additional encoding or metadata.
///
/// This can be used with an application or a service capable of sending images through MQTT.
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
///
/// ```yaml
/// # Example configuration.yaml entry
/// mqtt:
///   - camera:
///       topic: zanzito/shared_locations/my-device
/// ```
///
/// The sample configuration above can be tested by publishing an image to the topic from the console:
///
/// ```shell
/// mosquitto_pub -h <mqtt_broker> -t zanzito/shared_locations/my-device -f <camera_imaga.jpg>
/// ```
